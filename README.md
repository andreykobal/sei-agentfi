# SEI AgentFi - Project Description

## 1️⃣ Project Name

**SEI: AgentFi** - _AI-native DeFi platform for real-time insights and autonomous trading_

## 2️⃣ Problem

Launching tokens in DeFi remains an unstructured process: new projects often start without real liquidity, without market activity, and without access to algorithmic support or high-quality real-time analytics.

## 3️⃣ Solution

We are creating a standardized, automated method for launching and supporting DeFi tokens with real liquidity and market activity, managed by AI agents that provide real-time insights for decision-making.

## 4️⃣ How It Works (Key Features)

🔹🔥 **Conversational DeFi Interface** — Revolutionary chat-based UI where users execute complex DeFi operations through natural language, powered by AI agents with complete blockchain access and real-time market intelligence.

🔹🔥 **Real-time Market Intelligence** — The AI agent has full access to a historical database of tokens, transactions, prices, and events, providing actionable insights for traders and developers.

🔹🔥 **Agentic Trading via Autonomous Agents** — Autonomous AI agents automatically maintain liquidity, generate trading volumes, manage spreads, and optimize AMM parameters.

🔹 **AI-powered Token Factory** — Token launches through a convenient chat interface with automatic smart contract deployment and parameter configuration.

🔹 **Bonding Curve Mechanism** — Automatic creation of a bonding curve for initial liquidity and transparent token price growth.

🔹 **Graduate to AMM** — Tokens automatically transition from bonding curves to full AMM pools once certain market cap thresholds are reached.

## 5️⃣ Target Audience

**Token Developers** — Get out-of-the-box liquidity, trading bots, and analytics to support their projects.

**DeFi Traders** — Gain an AI assistant with access to all on-chain data for informed trading decisions.

**Meme Coin and Experimental Token Creators** — Quickly launch projects with transparent growth models.

## 6️⃣ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: SEI Network
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Uniswap V4 + custom bonding curve)
- **Indexer**: Ponder
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 for agents and chat
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi, RainbowKit
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Trading Bots**: Viem with market-making algorithms
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for event logs, MongoDB for projections

### Architecture

**Event-Sourced CQRS with External Event Stream and Stream-Driven Projections**

1️⃣ **External Event Stream (Blockchain Logs)**

2️⃣ **Stream Processing (Indexing / Projection)**

3️⃣ **Materialized Views / Read Models (MongoDB)**

4️⃣ **CQRS API (Analytics, Dashboards, Insights)**

---

Blockchain (Uniswap) serves as the **source of truth**, from which we read events like token launches, swaps, and liquidity changes.
These events are processed, projections are built into MongoDB (e.g., for token stats, prices, volumes, liquidity), and via separate CQRS routes, we deliver ready-made data for analytics, market dashboards, and insights.

## 7️⃣ Why It Matters / Benefits / Impact

The platform removes the main barrier in DeFi between a token idea and a functioning market with real activity.
It reduces risks for investors through transparent growth mechanisms, removes barriers for projects **(no need for expensive market makers)**, and creates a healthier token ecosystem where market activity is managed by AI agents, not manipulation.

# Smart Contracts - Bonding Curve Trading Platform

A decentralized token trading platform built on Uniswap V4 that implements a bonding curve mechanism inspired by PUMP.FUN. Tokens start in a bonding curve phase, then graduate to normal Uniswap trading at 20,000 USDT raised.

## Token Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Bonding Curve Trading

- **Token Creation**: Create tokens with metadata (name, symbol, image, social links)
- **Initial Supply**: 0 tokens - all minted through bonding curve purchases
- **Trading**: Direct buy/sell with bonding curve contract using PUMP.FUN formula
- **Price Mechanism**: Each purchase increases price, each sale decreases price

### Phase 2: Graduation (20,000 USDT raised)

- **Pool Creation**: Automatically creates Uniswap V4 liquidity pool
- **Liquidity Addition**: Remaining tokens (1B total - minted) + all USDT added as liquidity
- **Price Continuity**: Pool starts at final bonding curve price

### Phase 3: Normal Trading

- **Standard AMM**: Normal Uniswap trading with fixed 1B token supply
- **No More Minting**: Bonding curve disabled, price set by market forces

## Bonding Curve Formula

The bonding curve uses PUMP.FUN's mathematics with virtual reserves:

### Virtual Reserve Model

The bonding curve operates using virtual reserves that create a constant product:

```
Virtual USDT Reserve = 6,000 + x
Virtual Token Reserve = k ÷ (6,000 + x)
```

Where:

- `x` = Total USDT raised through bonding curve trading
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (constant product)
- `6,000` = Virtual initial USDT reserve

### Token Supply Function

The total tokens issued as a function of USDT contributed:

$$
S(x) = T - \frac{k}{6000 + x}
$$

Where:

- `T` = Virtual total token supply (≈ 1.073B tokens)
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (scaling constant)
- `x` = USDT contributed to the bonding curve

### Instantaneous Token Price

The current price per token (in USDT) at any point in the curve:

$$
p(x) = \frac{(6000 + x)^2}{k}
$$

**Properties:**

- Price starts low when `x` is small (early purchases cheaper)
- Price increases quadratically with total USDT raised
- Deterministic pricing follows mathematical formula
- No front-running during bonding curve phase

### Example Pricing

With our constants:

- **Initial Price** (x=0): `(6000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0000056 USDT per token`
- **At 1,000 USDT raised**: `(7000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0076 USDT per token`
- **At 10,000 USDT raised**: `(16000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0398 USDT per token`
- **At graduation (20,000 USDT)**: `(26000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.105 USDT per token`

This creates a smooth price curve that increases predictably with purchases.
