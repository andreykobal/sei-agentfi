## 3️⃣ Problem

The DeFi landscape is a paradox of opportunity and complexity. For developers, launching a token is just the beginning of a costly, manual battle for liquidity and market presence. For traders, navigating fragmented interfaces and avoiding failed projects is a full-time job. The core issue remains: **user intent is lost in translation**. There is no seamless bridge between a user's financial goals and automated, risk-managed on-chain execution. This friction costs capital, stifles innovation, and keeps DeFi from its true potential—leaving billions in unrealized value trapped behind technical barriers.

## 4️⃣ Solution

**SEI DeFAI provides automated token launches through AI-powered Abstraction Protocol.** Our Multiagentic AI ecosystem deploys DeAgents that autonomously manage token lifecycles - from AI-Driven Smart Contract deployment to market-making strategies. Users express their intent in natural language, and our Agentic AI handles: token creation, liquidity provision, risk management, and growth optimization.

## 5️⃣ How It Works (Key Features)

🔹🔥 **Intent-Centric Abstraction Protocol** — Natural language interface where users express goals like "create a gaming token with 2% hourly growth" and our Multiagentic AI ecosystem automatically executes complex DeFi operations through 20+ specialized tools.

🔹🔥 **DeAgents with Dedicated Wallets** — Autonomous AI agents with their own blockchain wallets providing Autonomous Liquidity Provision, executing 24/7 trading strategies with adaptive risk management and price impact analysis.

### Architecture

Blockchain (Uniswap) serves as the **source of truth**, from which we read events like token launches, swaps, and liquidity changes.

These events are processed, projections are built into MongoDB (e.g., for token stats, prices, volumes, liquidity), and via separate API routes, we deliver ready-made data for analytics, market dashboards, and insights.

## 🔟 Why It Matters / Benefits / Impact

SEI DeFAI solves a core problem in DeFi: the gap between launching a token and achieving real market activity.

By automating liquidity provisioning, trading volume, and analytics, the platform removes the need for manual intervention or expensive market makers. This reduces investor risk through transparent, rules-based price discovery and creates a more stable token ecosystem — where trading is driven by AI logic, not hype or manipulation.

✅ **Real-Time Conversational Analytics**: An AI assistant capable of answering complex on-chain data queries in natural language with 20+ specialized tools.

## Phase 2: Intelligence & Expansion — Beyond the Launch (Q1-Q2 2026)

🧠 **Off-Chain Intelligence Integration**: Enhance DeAgents with real-time social sentiment analysis from sources like X and Farcaster. Users can set intent-based rules like: _"If negative sentiment for my token spikes by 50%, automatically hedge 25% of the portfolio into USDC."_

📈 **Advanced Portfolio & Order Management**: Expand capabilities beyond new launches to manage entire existing portfolios on Sei. Introduce advanced, AI-optimized order types via the conversational interface:

- **AI-TWAP/DCA**: _"Slowly buy 10,000 SEI over the next 24 hours, but execute larger chunks when network gas is low."_
- **Automated Yield Farming**: _"Find the highest-yield stablecoin farm on Sei and move my idle USDC there."_

🛡️ **Proactive Risk-Hedging & Simulation**:

- **Pre-Transaction Simulation**: Before any agent action, the AI will confirm with the user, showing the simulated outcome, including slippage and fees.
- **Per-User Agent Contracts**: Offer users the option to deploy their DeAgent as a personal, non-custodial smart contract they exclusively own, providing ultimate security and control.

🌐 **Social & Messenger Integration**: Launch a Telegram Bot allowing users to manage their DeAgents, receive critical alerts, and perform trades directly from their mobile device, creating a viral on-ramp.

## Phase 3: Platform & Ecosystem — The Sovereign Economy (Q3 2026 & Beyond)

🏛️ **The DeAgent Marketplace**: Evolve from a tool into a platform. Launch a marketplace where expert traders and developers can create, share, and monetize their own DeAgent strategies. Novice users can "subscribe" to a proven agent strategy with a single click, creating a revenue-sharing ecosystem.

🛠️ **No-Code Strategy Builder**: To power the marketplace, we will release a visual, drag-and-drop interface for building custom agent logic. This will democratize agent creation, allowing anyone to design and deploy sophisticated strategies without writing a single line of code.

💼 **Institutional & B2B APIs**: Launch an enterprise-grade API for DAOs, crypto treasuries, and hedge funds to programmatically access our agentic infrastructure for treasury management, automated payroll, and market-making as a service.

🌌 **Multi-Chain Abstraction Protocol**: Expand the Abstraction Protocol to support other blockchain ecosystems, with Sei acting as the central coordination and settlement hub. This positions Sei as the "brain" for a network of interconnected AI agents operating across the entire Web3 landscape.

# Smart Contracts - Bonding Curve Trading Platform

A decentralized token trading platform built on Uniswap V4 that implements a bonding curve mechanism inspired by PUMP.FUN. Tokens start in a bonding curve phase, then graduate to normal Uniswap trading at 20,000 USDT raised.

## How it Works

<img width="3840" height="1230" alt="Untitled diagram _ Mermaid Chart-2025-07-22-050239" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4336e0d4-52e0-46bc-b3e9-f7444edbb888" />

## Token Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Bonding Curve Trading

- **Token Creation**: Create tokens with metadata (name, symbol, image, social links)
- **Initial Supply**: 0 tokens - all minted through bonding curve purchases
- **Trading**: Direct buy/sell with bonding curve contract using PUMP.FUN formula
- **Price Mechanism**: Each purchase increases price, each sale decreases price

### Phase 2: Graduation (20,000 USDT raised)

- **Pool Creation**: Automatically creates Uniswap V4 liquidity pool
- **Liquidity Addition**: Remaining tokens (1B total - minted) + all USDT added as liquidity
- **Price Continuity**: Pool starts at final bonding curve price

### Phase 3: Normal Trading

- **Standard AMM**: Normal Uniswap trading with fixed 1B token supply
- **No More Minting**: Bonding curve disabled, price set by market forces

## Bonding Curve Formula

The bonding curve uses PUMP.FUN's mathematics with virtual reserves:

### Virtual Reserve Model

The bonding curve operates using virtual reserves that create a constant product:

```
Virtual USDT Reserve = 6,000 + x
Virtual Token Reserve = k ÷ (6,000 + x)
```

Where:

- `x` = Total USDT raised through bonding curve trading
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (constant product)
- `6,000` = Virtual initial USDT reserve

### Token Supply Function

The total tokens issued as a function of USDT contributed:

$$
S(x) = T - \frac{k}{6000 + x}
$$

Where:

- `T` = Virtual total token supply (≈ 1.073B tokens)
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (scaling constant)
- `x` = USDT contributed to the bonding curve

### Instantaneous Token Price

The current price per token (in USDT) at any point in the curve:

$$
p(x) = \frac{(6000 + x)^2}{k}
$$

**Properties:**

- Price starts low when `x` is small (early purchases cheaper)
- Price increases quadratically with total USDT raised
- Deterministic pricing follows mathematical formula
- No front-running during bonding curve phase

### Example Pricing

With our constants:

- **Initial Price** (x=0): `(6000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0000056 USDT per token`
- **At 1,000 USDT raised**: `(7000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0076 USDT per token`
- **At 10,000 USDT raised**: `(16000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0398 USDT per token`
- **At graduation (20,000 USDT)**: `(26000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.105 USDT per token`

This creates a smooth price curve that increases predictably with purchases.
