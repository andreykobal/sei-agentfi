## 3️⃣ Problem

Traditional token launchpads suffer from fragmented user experiences, requiring technical expertise to navigate complex DeFi interfaces. Projects launch without Autonomous Liquidity Provision, lack AI Risk-Hedging mechanisms, and fail to provide Intent-Centric DeFi experiences that translate user goals into automated execution.

## 4️⃣ Solution

**SEI DeFAI revolutionizes token launches through our AI-powered Abstraction Protocol.** Our Multiagentic AI ecosystem deploys DeAgents that autonomously manage token lifecycles - from AI-Driven Smart Contract deployment to sophisticated market-making strategies. Users simply express their intent in natural language, and our Agentic AI handles everything: token creation, liquidity provision, risk management, and growth optimization.

## 5️⃣ How It Works (Key Features)

🔹🔥 **Intent-Centric Abstraction Protocol** — Revolutionary natural language interface where users express goals like "create a gaming token with 2% hourly growth" and our Multiagentic AI ecosystem automatically executes complex DeFi operations through 20+ specialized tools.

🔹🔥 **DeAgents with Dedicated Wallets** — Autonomous AI agents with their own blockchain wallets providing Autonomous Liquidity Provision, executing 24/7 trading strategies with adaptive risk management and price impact analysis.

🔹🔥 **AI-Driven Smart Contract Launchpad** — Conversational token creation where AI guides users through metadata collection, deploys contracts automatically, and initializes bonding curve mechanisms with transparent mathematical formulas.

🔹🔥 **Multiagentic Trading Intelligence** — Advanced market-making bots with growth targeting (0.5-5% hourly), portfolio rebalancing, randomized trade timing, and real-time strategy adjustment based on market conditions.

🔹 **AI Risk-Hedging & Analytics** — Real-time market intelligence with holder analysis, transaction monitoring, price impact assessment, and comprehensive trading history accessible through conversational queries.

🔹 **Autonomous Pool Graduation** — AI-managed transition from bonding curves to full Uniswap V4 AMM pools at 20,000 USDT raised, ensuring seamless liquidity continuity and price discovery.

## 6️⃣ Target Audience

**Token Developers** — Get out-of-the-box liquidity, trading bots, and analytics to support their projects.

**DeFi Traders** — Gain an AI assistant with access to all on-chain data for informed trading decisions.

**Meme Coin and Experimental Token Creators** — Quickly launch projects with transparent growth models.

## 7️⃣ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: SEI Network
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Uniswap V4 + custom bonding curve)
- **Indexer**: Ponder
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 for agents and chat
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB
- **Trading Bots**: Viem with market-making algorithms
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for event logs, MongoDB for projections

### Architecture

Blockchain (Uniswap) serves as the **source of truth**, from which we read events like token launches, swaps, and liquidity changes.

These events are processed, projections are built into MongoDB (e.g., for token stats, prices, volumes, liquidity), and via separate API routes, we deliver ready-made data for analytics, market dashboards, and insights.

## 8️⃣ Why It Matters / Benefits / Impact

AgentFi solves a core problem in DeFi: the gap between launching a token and achieving real market activity.

By automating liquidity provisioning, trading volume, and analytics, the platform removes the need for manual intervention or expensive market makers. This reduces investor risk through transparent, rules-based price discovery and creates a more stable token ecosystem — where trading is driven by AI logic, not hype or manipulation.

AI: "I'll help you create that token. What's the description and purpose?"
User: "A token for the fastest pony in Equestria"
AI: [Collects metadata, deploys contract] "Token created! Contract: 0x..."
```

**DeAgent Creation (Autonomous Liquidity Provision):**

```
User: "Create a trading bot for Rainbow Dash token with 2% hourly growth"
AI: "I'll deploy a DeAgent with dedicated wallet for autonomous trading..."
    → Calls getAllTokens() tool
    → Guides through Multiagentic AI configuration
    → Executes createMarketMakerBot() with AI Risk-Hedging parameters
    → "DeAgent deployed! Autonomous Liquidity Provision active with 100 USDT"
```

**Real-time Market Intelligence:**

```
User: "Who are the top holders of this token?"
AI: [Accesses current token context] "Here are the top 10 holders..."
User: "Show me recent trading activity"
AI: [Calls getTokenTransactions()] "Recent trades show..."
```

### 20+ Specialized DeAgent Tools

# Smart Contracts - Bonding Curve Trading Platform

A decentralized token trading platform built on Uniswap V4 that implements a bonding curve mechanism inspired by PUMP.FUN. Tokens start in a bonding curve phase, then graduate to normal Uniswap trading at 20,000 USDT raised.

## How it Works

<img width="3840" height="1230" alt="Untitled diagram _ Mermaid Chart-2025-07-22-050239" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4336e0d4-52e0-46bc-b3e9-f7444edbb888" />

## Token Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Bonding Curve Trading

- **Token Creation**: Create tokens with metadata (name, symbol, image, social links)
- **Initial Supply**: 0 tokens - all minted through bonding curve purchases
- **Trading**: Direct buy/sell with bonding curve contract using PUMP.FUN formula
- **Price Mechanism**: Each purchase increases price, each sale decreases price

### Phase 2: Graduation (20,000 USDT raised)

- **Pool Creation**: Automatically creates Uniswap V4 liquidity pool
- **Liquidity Addition**: Remaining tokens (1B total - minted) + all USDT added as liquidity
- **Price Continuity**: Pool starts at final bonding curve price

### Phase 3: Normal Trading

- **Standard AMM**: Normal Uniswap trading with fixed 1B token supply
- **No More Minting**: Bonding curve disabled, price set by market forces

## Bonding Curve Formula

The bonding curve uses PUMP.FUN's mathematics with virtual reserves:

### Virtual Reserve Model

The bonding curve operates using virtual reserves that create a constant product:

```
Virtual USDT Reserve = 6,000 + x
Virtual Token Reserve = k ÷ (6,000 + x)
```

Where:

- `x` = Total USDT raised through bonding curve trading
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (constant product)
- `6,000` = Virtual initial USDT reserve

### Token Supply Function

The total tokens issued as a function of USDT contributed:

$$
S(x) = T - \frac{k}{6000 + x}
$$

Where:

- `T` = Virtual total token supply (≈ 1.073B tokens)
- `k` = 6,438,000,006,000 (scaling constant)
- `x` = USDT contributed to the bonding curve

### Instantaneous Token Price

The current price per token (in USDT) at any point in the curve:

$$
p(x) = \frac{(6000 + x)^2}{k}
$$

**Properties:**

- Price starts low when `x` is small (early purchases cheaper)
- Price increases quadratically with total USDT raised
- Deterministic pricing follows mathematical formula
- No front-running during bonding curve phase

### Example Pricing

With our constants:

- **Initial Price** (x=0): `(6000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0000056 USDT per token`
- **At 1,000 USDT raised**: `(7000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0076 USDT per token`
- **At 10,000 USDT raised**: `(16000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.0398 USDT per token`
- **At graduation (20,000 USDT)**: `(26000)² ÷ 6,438,000,006,000 ≈ 0.105 USDT per token`

This creates a smooth price curve that increases predictably with purchases.
